## Welcome, traveller.

***This website is an all-in-one place to find projects I am, or have, working on, the technical experiments I delve into, and the things I simply enjoy, be they in the gaming or technological worlds.***

### About Me
<img align="right" width=200 height=250 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arbiter04032000/xhTech/master/Media/xavier_hancockcrop.jpg"> Xavier Hancock is a heavily technically-minded game designer, practiced in the art of breaking down patterns and puzzles to their core logic, learning the methods of these logics, and then rebuilding them into valuable new designs.<br>

## Projects
### Damnation
_Finished_<br>
_September 2020 - November 2020_<br>
Damnation is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler, with heavy horror elements and strategic gameplay.<br>
On this project, I served primarily as the technical designer, complementing our more gameplay and sound oriented gameplay designer, as well as our sole programmer. I also served as the lighting and VFX engineer as a secondary role.<br>

### PRJ Starshot
_Coming soon!_<br>
Take the role of the flag captain of a fleet of starships, and set out into the stars, taking on a mission of your choosing. What would you do to complete that mission, pray tell? What risks would you take? What of your crew and assets would you sacrifice? Would you make someone a predatious rival, or a convenient ally? What dark secrets might you uncover in your journeys...<br>
You will be able to answer these yourself.<br>

Project Starshot is a game that combines the storytelling elements of games like FTL: Faster Than Light and Rimworld with the strategy elements of the XCOM franchise, with most of the focus being on weaving a story through the decisions made by the player strategically and otherwise, and their ramifications, small and large.<br>
One other key design element of this project is the allowance for most of the game's content to be easily modified or added onto by third-party sources. Namely, to add more story segments, all one would need to do is import a new datatable that contains said elements, and link it to the story indexer. The same process would work on ships and other things, but those have yet to be implemented fully. <br>
If you wish to see more about this project as it develops, please follow me on LinkedIn and (when it's ready) the blogsite for the project.

### Magdora-verse
_The perpetual project_<br>
The Magdora-verse project is a hobby writing project, involving writing a fictional universe centered around a location of the same name.<br>
This is a project that has been running since 2016, and so far all public information about it is located in the link below. Updates to this wiki will come as I feel the information is ready- generally whenever the details are consistent enough for it to make sense.
